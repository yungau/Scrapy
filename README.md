# Web-scraping
 
This repository contrains two scripts that scrape the basic information of all shops or resturants appeared on the websites https://www.linkhk.com/tc/shop/?cid=&did=&scid= or https://www.linkhk.com/tc/dine/?cid=&did=&scid= .

linkhkSpider.py uses Python scraping framework Scrapy and hklinkSpider.py uses library requests.
